# README #

This is my little personal portfolio that contains demonstrative projects of mine. The idea of this portfolio is to mainly demonstrate what I am capable of and how I program in general.

Be mindful that not everything is yet finished, or has not been started! Everything will come through time.

This portfolio mainly offers:

- Programming in C++, C#, and Java.
- Basic data structures in both C++ and Java.
- API WEB development in C# with .Net Core.
- WEB application development in C# with .Net Core (to be started).
- SQL and Oracle PL/SQL skills.
- General database design (Up to third normal form) with Oracle and other database motors.
- And more as it's added. 

Other skills may be shown in the future, such as Python and PHP programming, and more.
