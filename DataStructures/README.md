# README #

In this folder, we're going to find some samples of my coding skills by pretty much creating some basic data structures in multple programming languages. Mainly C++ and Java. 

The data structures that I'll write are:

- A stack based on arrays with generic types.
- A stack based on nodes with generic types.
- A queue based on arrays with generic types.
- A queue based on nodes with generic types.
- A one-way linked list based on nodes with generic types.
- A one-way circular linked list based on nodes with generic types.
- A double-way circular linked list based on nodes with generic types.
- A binary tree based on nodes and integers.

Feel free to check out each folder with represents the programming languages and the 
data structures inside.
